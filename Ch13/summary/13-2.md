# Explanation

## What does the code do?

1. When interrupt or exception occurs, the first call is a function in ISR.asm

2. The function in assembly save registers to stack referenced by IST for
context switch and call function defined in C

3. After the C function, ISR restores the context and then return to
previous code

* functions in ISR.asm is intermediate functions

## Assembly

1. `%macro` and `%endmacro` is `#define` in C

2. `iretq` restores context that was stored into stack because of interrupt
and return to caller

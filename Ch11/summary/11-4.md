# Code: Part of Main.c that print key and linker script

```c

    // response with ACK code, activation fails

    	kChangeKeyboardLED(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE);
    }

# Explanation

## Note

1. Because CPU keep checking PS/2 Controller by looping, it is waste of
CPU time. From next chapter, the checking will be processed by `interrupt`

2. In the Keyboard.c, there are a lot of `duplicate` code. The code will be
refactored later

3. If you compile and run kernel without modifying linker script, kernel
`reboot` when you hit a key. This is because linker script discarded
.bss and .data sections when linking. This means that some code 
references wrong address and some data is inserted into image file.
To solve the problem, It is required to involve .bss and .data section
into program.

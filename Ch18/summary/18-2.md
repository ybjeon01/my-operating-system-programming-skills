# Code: InterruptHandler.[h, c], ISR.asm, Utility.[h, c], Main.c

# Explanation

## What does the code do?

a round-robin scheduler and more sophisticated task pool is integrated into
MINT64OS.

### InterruptHandler.[h, c], ISR.asm, Utility.[h, c]

MINT64OS is preemptive OS, so PIT interrupt calls scheduler to
choose a task to run. Interrupt handler must call kScheduleInInterrupt because
the way to switch context is different in interrupt context.

ISR.asm just added a function which is just intermediate function that calls
function written in C

Utility.c contains a variable that counts the number of PIT interrupt after
OS booting. This number is incremented by PIT counter0 interrupt handler

### Main.c

Main.c initializes task pool and task scheduler before PIC is activated

## C language

1. `volatile` (Utility.[h, c]) tells the compiler not to optimize anything that
has to do with the volatile variable

    * When you interface with hardware that changes the value itself

    * When there's another thread running that also uses the variable

    * When there's a signal handler that might change the value of the variable

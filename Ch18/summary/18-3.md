# Code: ConsoleShell.[h, c]

## What does the code do?

A new shell command is added. The command tests if scheduler and task pool
works by creating tasks.

There are two types of tasks you can create.

    * Type 1 writes arbitrary character to the corner

    * Type 2 shows pinwheel spinning at the bottom of screen

When you create those tasks, you can see that shell and the tasks works
concurrently.

As I said in 18-1, you can slow the task switching by executing `settimer`
command

## Note

I found some function names are inconsistent, and some functions belong to
where they should not be.

In the original code, List.c was implemented in wrong way, so number of items
can be zero although there are still items in list.

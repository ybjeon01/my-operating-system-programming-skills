Although Chapter 26 implemented some basic stdio functions, there are serious
problems with the hdd driver, such as the operating system hangs when reading
and writing files. Since I couldn't figure out which code was causing the
problem, in the next chapter I will implement a ram disk to use instead of
the hdd driver.

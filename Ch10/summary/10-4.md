# Explanation

## Note

### 64 bit Kernel C code
1. In `01.Kernel32`, binary was made by `concatenating` EntryPoint.bin and
Kernel32_C.bin. In memory layout, EntryPoint.bin is at 0x10000 and
Kerne32_c.bin is at 0x10200. EntryPoint.bin `exactly jump` to 0x10200 to
execute C code. However, In 02.Kernel64, I show different way
to make 64 bit kernel.

2. In `02.Kernel64`, EntryPoint.s is supposed to be at 0x200000 (2MB) in memory
layout, the code `calls` Main function in C code instead of jumping to specific
address. EntryPoint.s is compiled into `ELF` object file and all object files are
passed to linker script so it resolves the address problem. All we need is to make
sure that the 64 bit EntryPoint.s is loaded at 0x200000

### 64 bit Kernel Linker Script

1. They are almost the same as linker script in 01.Kernel32. The only
difference is that OUTPUT_ARCH is changed for `x86_64`, and `EntryPoint.o`
is the first line in `.text` section, and .text memory address

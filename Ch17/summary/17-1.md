# Code: Task.[h, c], AssemblyUtility.[h, asm]

# Explanation

## What does the code do?

The files helps other code to switch from a task to other task for purpose of
multitasking. Like interrupt, context switch function stores current task
registers to task structure and loads registers from next task to execute.
In MINT64OS, task data structure is very simple. It contains only id and
registers such as general registers and segment registers. 

* In the point of view of command task, it can yield CPU

* In the point of view of kernel, it forces to switch between tasks for
multitasking 

## Context Switch

1. In multitasking system, all tasks share the CPU. Because more than
one task uses the CPU at the same time, context switch, that stores current
task state and loads next task state, is required to implement multitasking
system.

### Preemptive Multitasking

1. Preemptive multitasking is forcing tasks to yield CPU, so other tasks can
uses CPU. To implement Preemptive Multitasking, PIT counter0 which is
connected to IRQ0 is utilized. Periodic interrupt forces context switch.

2. Currently, every task in MINT64OS has to yield CPU on its own. Otherwise, 
one task uses CPU forever.


## Note

1. task stack and task manager exist as array in ConsoleShell.c

2. Currently, concept of kernel and user land does not exist. Every task
shares the same page tree structure, and all segment/system descriptors, and
even RSP. This means that if a task has error code that accesses wrong
memory address, it can pollute kernel or other task memory area which
can causes serious problems

3. Switch context function is in AssemblyUtility.asm file. Also task stack
and manager is in ConsoleShell.c file. Because I think this is not right place
for the code to be, I will move the function to Task.asm and Task.c file
when I finish reading all chapters.

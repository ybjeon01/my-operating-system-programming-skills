# Explanation

## What does code do?

1. This code is READDATA part of 5-3.md with one change: preprocessor. If
FLOPPY is `288`, it read `36` sectors per a track, or if FLOPPY is `144` it
reads `18` sectors per a track

## Assembly

1. nasm also has a preprocessor. If you want to define macro from command, use `-D` option

    ```assembly
    %if FLOPPY == 144
        cmp al, 19 ; for 1.44MB
    %elif FLOPPY == 288
        cmp al, 37 ; for 2.88MB floppy which is default of QEMU
    %else
        %error "FLOPPY should be 144 or 288"
    %endif

    ; in shell
    ; nasm -D FLOPPY=144 -o BootLoader.bin BootLoader.asm
    ```

## MINT64OS Characteristics

1. MINT64OS is developed in QEMU environment. Because default floppy size of
QEMU is `2.88MB` which has `36 sectors` per tack, you should execute
`FLOPPY=288 make all` in root directory. If you want to make image, then
`FLOPPY=144 make all` in root directory

2. If you `FLOPPY=144 make all` and run the image in QEMU, you will find that
Virtual OS in 5-4.md does not work as intended because bootloader just loads
18 sectors out of 36 sectors in a track

3. Because the final code in this chapter has preprocessor, Makefile in
00.BootLoader and Makefine in root directory is also modified so that it can
take `FLOPPY env` from command line

# Code: Descriptor.c, InterruptHandler.c and Main.c

## What does the code do?

1. kPrintString becomes kPrintStringXY and it is now in Console.c

2. kPrintString function in most files are substituted with kPrintf function 

3. Main.c now check memory ram and run simple shell

## Note

1. `reboot` command works in QEMU emulator, but it is not work in modern 
computer.

2. `totalram` command does not show the correct size of ram because accessing
directly to physical address is not right way to check, although it is the
simplest way.

    * Some regions of memory is reserved by hardware so accessing or writing
    the address is not always working as expected. Sometimes, writing to the
    address causes rebooting. The address is unpredictable, so it is best not
    to use the region

    * The best way to get the memory map is using BIOS service because the
    manufacturer built the computer which means BIOS is the one that knows the
    structure very well.

    * use (INT15, 0xE820) BIOS service. The way to use it will be explained in the
    sub chapter. This is not in the MINT64OS book.
